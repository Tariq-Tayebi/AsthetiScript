# The AsthetiScript Programming Language

## What Is It
The AsthetiScript Programming Language is a compiled, programming language with syntax similar to Python and C/C++. Apart from containing many native features from many universal languages, AsthetiScript also combines its versatile, easy to understand syntax with attributes not in many programming languages. For example, AsthetiScript can make web applications accompanying or overtaking HTML and CSS, while performing advanced calculations with speed usually reserved for C and C++.

## Tutorial and Syntax

In AsthetiScript, a '>' symbol denotes parenthood and childhood, compared to a '.' in Python. AsthetiScript uses an '@' symbol to include libraries, including the standard library. At the start of every code, you must type ```@using std - asc```. 
### Text
AsthetiScript has very high text functionality. To do plain text, type ```asc>text>plain("Text")``` for plain text or ```asc>text("Text")``` for text with the same style. There are many ways to format in console.
For example:
```asc>text>orange("HI")```
```asc>text>underline("HI")```

You can also make a custom ASCII code:
```asc>text>customcode("HI", 40)```
